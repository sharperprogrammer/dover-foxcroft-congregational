                Here at the Dover Foxcroft Congregational Church we are committed to being the body of Christ at work in
                the world.<br><br>

                That work begins right here in our community but extends across our state, nation, and globe.<br><br>

        <h2>Heating Assistance</h2>

        <p class="detail">Everyone is well aware of rising energy costs. Here in northern New England those costs can be more than an inconvenience, they can make ones home uninhabitable and put children at risk. To address these needs our church has established an assistance program that works with area agencies to provide heating oil or propane to those in need. By working with these agencies we are able to ensure that we are filling the gaps and not duplicating services. We are grateful to <a href="https://www.penquis.org/">Penquis Cap</a> for working with us in this endeavor.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Video Broadcast</h2>

        <p class="detail">As an outreach to those who are homebound because of health or limited mobility we record our Sunday Services. You can <a href="https://vimeo.com/dfcongo">watch our services through this website.</a></p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Community Dinner Project</h2>

Our community now has a free meal almost every monday of the year. Most meals are held at our facility. Some are also hosted at the United Methodist and United Baptist Churches.</p>
