                The Rev. Dr. Stephen (Steve) Hastings started here on August 1 as our Interim Minister and became our Designated Term Pastor on April 1, 2019 for the next five years. He and his wife, Jill, will be moving into the parsonage full time. In Maine, Steve has served churches in Winthrop, Kennebunk, Leeds, and Hartford. He has also been very active in the Maine Conference over the years, most recently as Clerk of the Board and convener of the Earth Care and Spirituality Resource Team.<br><br>

                Steve has a PhD in environmental ethics and spirituality, an interest that had a lot to do with his decision to enter the ministry almost 30 years ago. He hopes to share some of that with us during his time here.
